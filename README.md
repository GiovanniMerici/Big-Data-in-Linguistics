# Big-Data-in-Linguistics
Supporting codes for big-data analysis applied to linguistics.

The codes were written by Giovanni Merici, graduate student in biology and master student in "Scienze Biomolecolari, Genomiche e Cellulari" at the Università degli Studi di Parma (Parma, Italy). They serve as a support to the master thesis (mémoire) of Axelle Domingues, graduate student in modern letters and master student in "Sciences du langages : linguistique française et générale" at Sorbonne Université (Paris, France). Thus, this repository is the result of this collaboration.

Analysis of the apparition and evolution of french connective phrases, from ancient french (starting in the 9th century) to classical french (ending at the end of the 18th century) from the databases Base de Français Médiéval (BFM) http://bfm.ens-lyon.fr/ and Frantext https://www.frantext.fr. The BFM's corpus extends from the 10th century to the 15th century. Frantext contains more corpora but does not date as back as the BFM, and as a result the corpus used for this research extends from the 12th century to the 18th century. The precision will explain in the future possible gaps in results in between both bases. Also, the choice to use these two databases at once is self-explained by the apparent complementarity. The scope of the analysis is using basic tools offered by Pandas, Scipy and Matplotlib to analyse the vast quantity of data offered by the database. 
Pandas allows to handle dataframe in the simplest possible manner.
Matplotlib offers the possiblity of plotting graphs, fucnctional to the rapresentation of a vast range of data. 

Given the possibility of exporting data from the website directly in an excel file it's possible to import it into the script and quickly sort the data to obtain the desidered graphs. 

After few changes to the exported data it's possible for any users to exploit this simple script to visualise data in a ordered fashion.

 This work conducts the diachronic study of french subordinating conjunctions, from latin to classical french,
The data's organization allowed by Giovanni Merici's participation offers graphs that reveal without data loss the many tendencies in the evolution of several subordinating conjunctions over centuries. 

Abstract of the master thesis titled "French subordinating conjunctions in diachrony" 
The construction of the complex sentence as a structured and conventional unit in the French language dates back only to the end of classical French, meaning the end of the 18th century. From a diachronic perspective, the completion of this linguistic phenomenon is recent. Nonetheless, it is the result of the evolution of syntactic integration in French for over more than six centuries, starting from the earliest stage of the language. This master thesis focuses on a specific aspect of this area of study: subordinating conjunctions. It proposes the empirical analysis of their morphosyntactic evolution in diachrony from Latin to classical French, and of their role as hypotactic links in order to clarify the chronology of the tendencies leading to the construction of the complex sentence. Thus, we show that the focus of this study is indeed revealing of the transition from parataxis to hypotaxis and of the development of subordination in French. Consequently, it adds on the primary aim of research in French diachronic linguistics, that is, the description sustained by empirical data of its evolution from its mother language, Latin.
Keywords: subordinating conjunctions, hypotaxis, subordination, complex sentence, parataxis, Latin, French, diachrony, morphosyntax, empirical and analytical approach, functional-typological approach.
