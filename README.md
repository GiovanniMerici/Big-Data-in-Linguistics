# Big-Data-in-Linguistics
Supporting code for big-data analysis in linguistics

Specific code used for the first year master thesis "French subordinating conjunctions in diachrony", Chapter 2. 

Code "2- SeabornEntireCorpus" is used in ยง2.3 of the work. It yields all the graphs for the representation of repartition and evolution of all the subordinating conjunctions.

Code "3- SeabornVariationQue-CequeCorpus" is used in ยง2.4 of the work. It yields the graphs for the representation of the repartition and evolution of the variation que/ce que in subordinating conjunctions "pour (ce) que" and "par (ce) que". It shows the comparison of that variation in one form and then does an overall comparison of it in both.
